for linting we use package "flake8"
Run it through Docker Compose
            >>>>>>>> docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "flake8" <<<<<<<

            and it will shows the errors in our code , the line and the error type
            remmber to fix the errors starting from the bottom !

for testing we gonna use Django test suite and its a framework that comes with django 
specificly for running tets on django pro .
we gonna set up the test for each django pro we create and then we gonaa run it trough Docker Compose!

>>>>>>>>>>> docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "python manage.py test" <<<<<<<
